Autonomous Santa's Workshop Assembly (ASWA) is a Christmas-themed project this is a mock assembly line that uses elf robots, reindeer sensors, and AI sorting techniques to sort presents from naughty and nice.

This assembly uses a line of stages, which include the vision, control, sorting, and dropoff robot stage. 
Through the use of different motors, servos, custom parts, and a full conveyor belt the ASWA system can be achieved to deliver color sorted presents. 
The system also uses an Elf Robot to help take presents to their final destination through the use of line sensing to then deliver them to their final sorting position.
